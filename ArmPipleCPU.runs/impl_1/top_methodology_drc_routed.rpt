2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at arm1/IEStage/alu/mult_full of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at arm1/IEStage/alu/mult_full__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at arm1/IEStage/alu/mult_full__1 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch arm1/IDStage/CtrUnite/shtyped_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin arm1/IDStage/CtrUnite/shtyped_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch arm1/IDStage/CtrUnite/shtyped_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin arm1/IDStage/CtrUnite/shtyped_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
